# Scientific Training Center for Plant Biotechnologies
## Modern Plant Breeding - "Regular" level

Data and scripts for creation and analysis of experimental Designs useful for screening large collections of entries. We are covering:  

1. Augmented Block Design
2. Balanced Incomplete Block Design - BIBD
3. Youden Square
4. Simple Square Lattice (among other lattices)
5. alpha-lattice

Making the best of your trials is compulsory for sucessful GWAS
