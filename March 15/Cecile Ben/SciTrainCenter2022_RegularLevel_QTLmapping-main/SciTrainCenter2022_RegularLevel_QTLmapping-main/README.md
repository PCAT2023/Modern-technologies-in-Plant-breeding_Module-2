### 1. How to build genetic map, as a first step towards QTL detection using biparental populations?
Data and scripts for genetic linkage mapping in bi-parental segregating populations.

the R `qtl` package is used to build genetic maps.

### 2. QTL mapping

Data and scripts for analysis of QTLs in bi-parental segregating populations. Here, the R `qtl` package is used to detect the QTLs.

We are covering the main methods from simple ANOVA to the most efficient MQM method.

To get ready for the practical, please download the following software/R packages to your local machine

1. [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
2. R packages: [qtl] (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qtl/)

### useful trick :

You may download the repository as a zip file to your own machine and appropriate folder: **Use CODE / Download ZIP**. After extraction, all elements will be in place.
